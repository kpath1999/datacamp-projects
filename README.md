# Data Science Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of mini-data science projects that I've been working on. I plan to incorporate components of these mini-projects into a larger project in the near future.

In-depth descriptions are being included within each of the repositories.

## List of Projects

1. **`01-classification-song-genre`** --> classifying songs as either rock or hip-hop

Above is table describing the difference a passion mindset and craftsman's mindset. My intention is to develop the latter. With a mental skill like computer programming, it remains the case that I would learn best through practice and repetition - the natural learning process. Mindlessly consuming MOOCs and certifications will only lead to diminishing returns after a point.
