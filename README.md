## A list of mini-data science projects I'm working on.
<p>Hey there. This repository is a compilation of mini-data science projects I've been working on. I hope to include components of this within a larger project I begin soon. </p>
<p>A tabular list of projects will be included here soon. For now, this is what I have.</p>
