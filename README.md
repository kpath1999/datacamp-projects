# Data Science Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of mini-data science projects that I've been working on. I plan to incorporate components of these projects into a larger project in the near future.

A tabular list of projects will be added soon. For now, here's what I have:

- **Classifying songs as either rock or hip-hop** ([source](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/449))

- **Predicting whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or not** ([source](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-python-hotel-booking-demand))
