# Data Science Projects Repository

The projects included within the repository have been meticulously curated by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/machine-learning-projects-for-all-levels). I've been using their notebooks as a guide, covering applications from predictive analytics using Random Forests to developing AI-powered chatbots with Transformers -- connecting theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

In-depth descriptions have been included within each of the notebooks.

## Inspiration

> “We learn a foreign language by actually speaking it as much as possible, not by reading books and absorbing theories. The more we speak and practice, the more fluent we become.”

With a mental skill like computer programming, it remains the case that I would learn best through practice and repetition - the natural learning process. Mindlessly consuming MOOCs and certifications will only lead to diminishing returns after a point.

![Craftsman's mindset](craftsman-mindset.png)

Above is a table describing the difference between a passion mindset and a craftsman mindset ([source](https://medium.com/@preetipooja/building-a-craftsman-mindset-vs-a-passion-mindset-4833133c718c)). I intend to develop the latter. The goal of this repository is to build skills. This can only be done by engaging in the hard, tedious task of programming and running into all sorts of unforeseen errors.

I will dial up the difficulty as I work on more projects. This would include more data processing, longer timelines, and managing MLOps infrastructure. The skills will build up over time.
